**Table Top Craft** is a fun little Mod that was developed to add working board games to Minecraft. Currently the Mod only comes with one board game, which is chess. If people are interested in the Mod, I would be happy to add more board games in the future. The board games added by this Mod come with a huge list of customization options and settings. Some of which are: Altering the tile colors, altering the piece colors and changing the move highlight colors. The board games are also playable completely without any GUIs, after choosing your settings. You can simply click on the block and play! This Mod doesn't require two players, but it is recommended to use it on servers. If you are a singleplayer person don't worry you can still use the Block on your own, you just simply wont have an opponent, or you can use the blocks as decoration!

**Q:** Can I use this Mod in my Modpack  
**A:** Yes absolutely! Feel free to use my Mods in your Modpacks.

**Q:** Can you update the Mod to version \[x\]  
**A:** I always try to keep my Mods up to date, so if there hasn't been an update it simply means I haven't had time to work on it!

**Q:** Can you backport the Mod to version \[x\]  
**A:** No I will not backport my Mods, old versions are versions of the past and I wont go out of my way to support them!

**Q:** What is a "**FEN**"  
**A:** FEN is short for "****Forsyth-Edwards-Notation****" to put it simply its a standard **notation** for describing a particular board position of a **chess** game.
